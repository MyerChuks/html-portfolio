<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Shot Caller</h3>
<p>A movie about a once-successful business man fresh out of prison is forced to orchestrate a brazen crime or risk his family.</p>
<h3>The Wolf of Wall Street</h3>
<p>Leonardo DiCaprio is the reason I love this movie so much and his unbelievable oscar winning performance, this movie streamlines how a broke hungry-for-sucess trader uses his resources well to become wealthy which is short lived due to illegal activity.</p>
<h3>Donnie Brasco</h3>
<p>Another fantastic film that showcases the Italian mafia in ways never seen before. An undercover FBI agent infiltrates a New York Mafia family and develops a close friendship with a mob hitman, putting his job and life on the line.</p>
